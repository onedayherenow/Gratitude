# Gratitude

Hello dear friends,
  
  I am in a race against time
    & I feel very emotional (think Chopin's Nocturnes)
      
      Because I've been having so much fun
        & I love and resonate so strongly with the way you teach at ElevenFifty Academy
        
          & I feel it in my bones it's in my nature to create
            I've been self studying dev for a few years now
              & I have studied with Java, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS,,, this is why I
                
                Here now with all my heart and mind,..
                  I beg you sweet people, who simply want to help others
                    To have mercy on me, and grace me with the opportunity to help others as well
                      With the knowledge you may grace me with bestowment, if you wish
                        & accept me with open arms into this Academy
                        
                          You & I we speak the same language.
                            I may not know the highest resolution of pixels of software architecture the way YOU do yet
                              However I am an eternal student and there is something so beautiful about logic
                              
                                Take me with you into the language
                                  
                                   I wish only to listen to you
                                     & follow what you say
                                      so that I may also
                                        speak some day soon
                                          & translate these poems to you: 
                                            My dear ElevenFifty friends
                                              Through the .NET
                                                Through the quantum vacuum
                                                  
                                                    It's all about geometry
                                                      Thank you Pythagoras
