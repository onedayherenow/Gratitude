# Gratitude

        Hello dear friends,

          I am in a race against time
            & I feel very emotional (think Chopin's Nocturnes)
          
                & I feel it in my bones it's in my nature to create
                  I've been self studying dev for a few years now
                    & I have studied with Java, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS,,, this is why I

                          You & I we speak the same language.
                            I may not know the highest resolution of pixels of software architecture the way YOU do yet
                              However I am an eternal student and there is something so beautiful about logic
                              
                                Take me with you into the language
                                  
                                   I wish only to listen to you
                                     & follow what you say
                                      so that I may also
                                        speak some day soon
                                          & translate these poems to you: 
                                            My dear ElevenFifty friends
                                              Through the .NET
                                                Through the quantum vacuum
                                                  
                                                    It's all about geometry
                                                      Thank you Pythagoras
                                                  
                                                   
                                                                  
                                                                   I love learning the geometry physics computer and mathematical-
                                                        logical arts because it creates a new medium for me to express myself emotionally and creatively 
                                    
                                    & I have a strong affinity for whole brained synergy         
                                                between the left and right brains, the "heart and the mind"
                                                
                                                  However I believe the heart should always take the reigns only if it is all expressed logically



                              Im not assuming. I agree assumptions are dangerous and that's the foundation of physics. 
                                      Remove all assumptions (ocahm's razor) and start from first principles, 
                                      aka the energy value of a system and study 
                                      it's dynamical architecture and study the relationships 
                                      between systems.




& then study your own "nature" what interests you gravitate towards and are inspired by.
              And then look to see how you can logically create a sypathetic harmonic resonance with the largest scale of a system  possible (aka the universe)




                      I have been gifted with a loving family and God that gives me more than I deserve.  
                              Therefore I am seeing this as an opportunity to follow my inspiration & 
                              realize logically how I can serve the universe and my family 
                              in a way that I feel is in alignment with what I'm here to do to help others 




                                      So this app idea I'm really excited about & love


                          Because it fulfills the need to help others with something i believe in


          Math informs geometry which informs both music and physics, and physics informs biology and chemistry, as well as cosmology and music again
